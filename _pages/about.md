üéì I'm a PhD candidate in Information Technology @ Politecnico di Milano

üî¨ Doing bioinformatic research is my way of trying to make the world a better place. 

üß¨ I'm interested both in human and viral genomics ü¶† 

üë®‚Äçüíª I develop software instruments and methods that biology experts can use to improve our understanding of current and future viral threats.

# üîç 3 years of research in brief

**Data modeling & intgration pipelines:** I contributed in developing a vast, integrated viral sequence database, including data and metadata from diverse sources and viral species ([ViruSurf](../files/ViruSurf%20NAR.pdf)). Additionally, I contributed to crafting essential tools with wide-reaching significance within the scientific community ([VirusViz](../files/VirusViz%20NAR.pdf), [EpiSurf](../files/EpiSurf_DATABASE.pdf), [CoV2K](../files/CoV2K_model.pdf)). These tools facilitate the analysis of SARS-CoV- 2 virus evolution, enhancing our comprehension of its transmission mechanisms and aiding in the formulation of effective countermeasures (i.e., vaccines). 

**AI reasoning on knowledge graphs:** I used a knowledge and reasoning representation language to bring artificial intelligence to the CoV2K knowledge-base. This framework was [used](../files/rule_ml.pdf) to answer several interesting questions about SARS-CoV-2 variants and phenotypic effcts. 

**Population genomics:** I built an API to ease the selection genomic populations and assess genomic characteristcs in the 1000 Genomes Project, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Combining gene annotations, [this API](../files/varsum.pdf) provides summary information about any population defined with fine-grained filters on DNA variants and metadata. 

**Viral recombination and reassortment** Furthermore, I contributed to develop a cutting-edge method that significantly heightens the detection rate and speed of recombination events, offering a vital asset in our readiness to combat future pandemics or epidemics ([RecombinHunt](../files/v2_RecombinHunt___NatureCommunications.pdf)). Currently, I'm studying a method to detect reassortment and recombination in Influenza virus and other segmented genomes.
